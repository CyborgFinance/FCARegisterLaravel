Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) API Client Library wrapper for Laravel.

## The Financial Services Register

The online Financial Services Register (FS Register) is a public record of financial services firms, individuals and other bodies regulated by the FCA.

The online FS Register provides an online search for firms that are or have been regulated by the FCA. It also allows users to search for businesses that are or have been registered with the FCA under the FSMA, the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, the Payment Services Regulations 2009, and the Electronic Money Regulations 2011. Access to the online FS Register is free; it is suitable for ad-hoc searches for authorised and registered firms and individuals.

### The Financial Services Register API Service

The FCA API is a new service offered by the Financial Conduct Authority, its in early stages with limited data points. You will first need to [Register an Account](https://register.fca.org.uk/Developer/s/) to get an API Key.

It is a RESTful API based on HTTPS requests and JSON responses, requiring an API username and key for authentication.

The FS Register API currently sets a maximum limit of 10 requests per 10 seconds, which is periodically subject to change.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require cyborgfinance/fcaregisterlaravel
```

Add the following to your Environment File:

```bash
FCA_EMAIL="your@email.com"
FCA_KEY="YOUR_FCA_API_KEY"
```

OR

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Cyborgfinance\Fcaregisterlaravel\FcaregisterlaravelServiceProvider" --tag="fcaapi-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
  'email' => env('FCA_EMAIL', 'your@email.com'), // FCA API Email Address
  'key' => env('FCA_KEY', 'YOUR_FCA_API_KEY'), // FCA API KEY
  'api_version' => '0.1', // FCA API VERSION
  'api_url' => 'https://register.fca.org.uk/services/', // FCA API URL
  'api_timeout' => 5, // FCA API TIMEOUT in seconds
];

```

## Usage

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Cyborgfinance\Fcaregisterlaravel\Fcaapi;

class Testing extends Controller {

    public function __invoke(Request $request){

      $fcaFrnNumber = 919921; //FCA Firm Reference Number (FRN)

      $fcaApi = new Fcaapi();
      $result = $fcaApi->firmDetails($fcaFrnNumber)->json(); //Queries FCA Register

      dd($result); // Outputs Array

    }
}
```

or

```php
namespace App\Http\Controllers;
use Cyborgfinance\Fcaregisterlaravel\Fcaapi;

class Testing extends Controller {

    public function __invoke(Request $request){

      $fcaFrnNumber = 919921; //FCA Firm Reference Number (FRN)

      $result = Fcaapi::firmDetails($fcaFrnNumber)->json(); //Queries FCA Register

      dd($result); // Outputs Array

    }
}
```

Both of these examples will output:

```bash

## TODO

## Name -  Service provider uses 'fcaapi' but package name is 'fcaregisterlaravel'
1. Update package name in service provider to match composer.json
2. Rename config file from fcaapi.php to fcaregisterlaravel.php
3. Update all config references throughout codebase
4. Add tests for package discovery and installation
5. Test config file publishing
6.  Verify all Laravel package tool features work correctly
